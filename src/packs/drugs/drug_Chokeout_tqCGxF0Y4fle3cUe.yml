  description: >-
    A chem that briefly induces severe swelling of the mucous membranes,
    Chokeout is odorless and tasteless, but must be consumed in food or drink
    and naturally degrades after twelve hours. A subject who consumes a dose of
    Chokeout must make a Physical save; on a failure, they are strangled to
    unconsciousness for an hour, waking up with one hit point at the end. On a
    success, they take 1d10 non-lethal damage as they struggle to breathe. On a
    natural saving throw of 1, the victim chokes to death.
