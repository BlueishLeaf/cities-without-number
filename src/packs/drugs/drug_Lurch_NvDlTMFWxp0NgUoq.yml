  description: >-
    An emergency stimulant meant to shock a downed ally back into mobility,
    Lurch heals 1d10 damage plus the physician's Heal skill on application,
    adding one System Strain to the target. Each dose of Lurch after the first
    each day increases the required Heal skill by one, so the third dose
    requires Heal-2 to successfully administer. Lurch only works on conscious
    and stabilized targets; the shock will kill a Mortally Wounded subject that
    hasn't been made stable.
