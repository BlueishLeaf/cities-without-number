    A neurobooster favored among hackers and knowledge workers, Window augments
    the user's focus and mental reaction speed at the cost of distracting them
    from their terrestrial surroundings. A Window user can trade their Move
    action to gain a bonus Main Action that can only be used for cyberspace
    actions. Each time this is done in a scene, however, the user gains one
    System Strain. One dose lasts for one scene.
