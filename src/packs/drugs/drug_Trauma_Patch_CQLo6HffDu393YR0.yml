  description: >-
    A theoretically foolproof cocktail of coagulants, stimulants, and
    painkillers, a trauma patch can be applied to a Mortally Wounded ally to
    stabilize them on a successful Int or Dex/Heal skill check against
    difficulty 6, with a +1 difficulty penalty for each full round since the
    subject went down. The patch is useless after six rounds. Trauma patches
    cannot revive victims downed by poisons or diseases, or those dismembered by
    explosives or heavy weapons.
