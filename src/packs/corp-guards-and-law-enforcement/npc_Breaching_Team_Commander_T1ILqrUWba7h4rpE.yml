        flash protectors, but additional functionality must be implanted

        System Strain cost of cybernetic eye implants.

        <b>Frag grenades</b> inflict 2d6 damage on all victims in range, plus
        the chance for a Traumatic Hit. An Evasion save can halve a frag
        grenade's damage, and each point of melee AC the target has above 14
        reduces the final damage total by one point, possibly down to zero.
