      description: >-
        While a single cybernetic eye can be implanted, it is recommended that
        both be replaced at the same time to improve neural adaptation. These
        cybereyes are clearly artificial, though most are styled in attractive
        or striking fashions. They all have perfect 20/20 vision and integral
        flash protectors, but additional functionality must be implanted
        separately. A user with a pair of cybereyes or syntheyes halves the
        System Strain cost of cybernetic eye implants.

      description: >-
        Hardwired control points interface with the onboard targeting systems of
        most modern firearms. When using a modern firearm, the PC ignores range
        penalties and negates up to 2 points of hit penalties for cover,
        concealment, or prone targets. Once per scene, as an Instant action,
        they can reroll a missed attack roll with a gun.

      description: >-
        <b>Advanced weapons</b> employ modern polymers, sophisticated
        metallurgy, fractal edges, electro-stun tech, and a small legion of
        marketers to sell products that are distinctly superior to the plain
        steel edges of a prior age. An advanced micro-edged butcher knife can go
        through bone like bamboo and keep an edge for weeks between sharpenings.
        The more martial offerings go to even greater lengths in their
        marketing, with some enterprising serial killers and gang enforcers
        inking exclusivity deals with particular knife manufacturers. Due to the
        sheer ubiquity and availability of melee weapons, they're often treated
        with less suspicion than firearms. A corp cop might bring somebody in
        for an "illegal knife", but only if he already wanted them for a
        different and better reason. Nightclubs and bars might expect firearms
        to go in the locker at the entrance, but they're often disinclined to go
        combing their patrons for every suspiciously-sharp hair ornament or
        multipurpose fashion accessory they might carry.
