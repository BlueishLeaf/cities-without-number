    Guards of this quality usually have no useful combat cyber installed in
    them, as skinmod tattoos and gang-related dental implants don't count.

      description: >-
        <b>Light and heavy pistols</b> are categorized by the caliber of the
        bullet they fire. Some operators prefer the low recoil and high mag
        capacity possible with a low-caliber round, while others like to have a
        little more certainty in dropping the targets they hit.

        <b>Knives, clubs, swords, and other simple melee weapons</b> are
        available almost anywhere on the street. Particularly impoverished
        gangers sometimes fashion makeshift machetes and improvised shivs when
        better can't be obtained. Such weapons are effectively free, but have a
        -1 penalty to hit and damage rolls due to their ungainly make.
