  biography: >-
    One of a class of featherlight aircraft, a flyer is woven of the lightest,
    thinnest, strongest materials available at its price point, and can provide
    cheap aerial recon or transit over rough terrain for its single occupant.
    Such flyers are light enough to be broken down into components that can be
    easily transported by a pickup truck.
