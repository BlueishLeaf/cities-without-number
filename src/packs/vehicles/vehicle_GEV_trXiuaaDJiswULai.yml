  biography: >-
    Ground effect vehicles have evolved considerably from their 20th-century
    ancestors, and their armored pneumatic skirts and high-efficiency engines
    can send them over terrain that might defeat a tracked tank. The sacrifice
    in armor weight is generally deemed acceptable, given the usual opposition
    these vehicles face.
