    By rearranging wiring, adding mass, and overriding safety protocols, an
    additional hardpoint can be added to a drone. This mod adds one point of
    Encumbrance to portable drones, though this doesn't affect their maximum
    weapon size. The cost is 50% of the drone's base cost plus the weapon.
