  effect: Gain eidetic memory
  description: >-
    A synthetic eidetic memory is granted by this implant, with formalized
    bodies of knowledge easily cross-referenced and recollected. Once per day,
    as an Instant action, reroll any failed Int-based skill check. This memory
    can be difficult to control, however, and unwanted allusions can overwhelm
    the desired datum. If the user rolls a natural 2 on any Int skill check, it
    automatically fails and cannot be recovered by any rerolling ability.
