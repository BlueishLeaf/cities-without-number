  description: >-
    One unit of cranial Memory is installed with a subdermal upload pad. The
    person uploading the data can set a passphrase; while the implant user can
    erase the data, they can't download it again without the passphrase, which
    is usually told only to the data's intended recipient. Courier memory is
    exceptionally well-hidden and even medical scans take a -2 penalty to find
    it.
