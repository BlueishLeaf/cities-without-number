  effect: Gain 3 HP/level vs hacker dmg
  description: >-
    A system favored by hackers, a Neural Buffer rearranges the user's brain
    topography, making it more difficult to harm the user with neural feedback.
    The user gains an additional 3 hit points per level that can only absorb
    cyberspace damage from Stun or Kill Verbs. These phantom hit points refresh
    completely each hour.
