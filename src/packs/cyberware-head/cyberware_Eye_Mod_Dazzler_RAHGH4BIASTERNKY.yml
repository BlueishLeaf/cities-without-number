  description: >-
    This mod can emit a dazzling strobe of intense light, dazing and
    disorienting those standing up to five meters in front of the user. The
    strobe is triggered up to once per round as an On Turn action and adds one
    System Strain. Victims without eye protection must make a Physical saving
    throw or take a -4 penalty to their AC and hit rolls for the next 1d6
    rounds. A victim can be targeted by this dazzling only once per scene.
