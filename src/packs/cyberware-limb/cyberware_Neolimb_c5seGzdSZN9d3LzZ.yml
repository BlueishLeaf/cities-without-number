  effect: Add a new additional limb
  description: >-
    The user gains an additional limb that normal humans lack. Usual choices
    involve an additional pair of arms or manipulatory mechano-tentacles, though
    functional prehensile tails are popular too. One installation of the cyber
    covers paired limbs or a single tail or body-mounted tendril up to 3 meters
    long. Neolimbs can support up to one Encumbrance point of non-weaponry
    built-in tech and add two items to the user's Readied encumbrance allowance.
    Neolimbs can hold or grip objects, but cannot employ additional shields or
    grant extra actions.
