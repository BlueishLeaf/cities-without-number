  description: >-
    Functioning only for a user with at least one Body cybersystem to serve as a
    motor substrate, "zombie wires" allow a user to keep functioning even at
    zero hit points. As an Instant action at zero hit points, the user can give
    their body a one-sentence command involving physical action. Their insensate
    flesh will blindly carry out that action for up to six rounds until it is
    complete or they take up to one quarter of their maximum hit points in
    further damage, which will kill them instantly. Time spent under Zombie
    Wires counts against a user's stabilization time limit. Triggering this
