    These bundles of gear are carefully packed for minimal weight. Toolkits give
    a tech the gear they need for basic repairs and construction, while medical
    kits provide first aid implements. Cyberdoc kits contain everything medical
    kits do, as well as gear for cyber maintenance or even emergency
    implantation. Survival kits are for badlands operations, with water
    filtration, firemaking tools, and other such gear for extended wilderness
    stays.
