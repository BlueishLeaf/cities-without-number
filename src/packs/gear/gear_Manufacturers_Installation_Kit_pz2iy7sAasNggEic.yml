    These tools and technical resources are usually restricted to licensed
    installation vendors of a given cyberware company. They grant a +1 skill
    check bonus when installing or removing cyberware made by that manufacturer.
    They are closely tracked, and it can be difficult to find a corp doc willing
    to sell them under the table.
