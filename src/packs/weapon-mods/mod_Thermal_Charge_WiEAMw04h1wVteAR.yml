    Usable only on melee or thrown weapons, the mod adds a bank of heat cells to
    the weapon. The weapon then inflicts +2 damage and Shock to all creatures
    not impervious to heat. The cells are activated as an On Turn action, but
    last for only two fights before requiring an hour to swap batteries and let
    the elements cool.
