  description: >-
    Usable only on firearms, the weapon's barrel and firing mechanism is altered
    to accept soft, electrically-charged stun rounds. The firearm's range is
    halved, it takes a -2 penalty to damage, and it loses its Trauma Die, but
    all damage it inflicts is treated as non-lethal. Stun rounds do no
    significant harm to inanimate objects.
