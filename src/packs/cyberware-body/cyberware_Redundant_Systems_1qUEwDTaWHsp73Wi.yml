  description: >-
    Several pieces of prosthetic support cyber are preemptively installed to
    mitigate future trauma. When the user takes a Major Injury, they may instead
    choose to have the Redundant Systems critically damaged instead of accepting
    the major injury roll result. Redundant Systems can be installed more than
    once, but the System Strain inflicted increases by one point each time.
