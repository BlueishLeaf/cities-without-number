  effect: Immune to normal disease/toxin
  description: >-
    A wide-spectrum array of blood scrubbers, intake filters, and microbial
    barriers grants the user effective immunity to most natural diseases and
    non-synthetic toxins. Weaponized toxins and certain exotic natural
    afflictions can still affect the user, but they get a +2 bonus on all saving
    throws against them. The system automatically alerts the user if they have
    been exposed to a recognized disease or toxin, whether or not it affects
    them.
