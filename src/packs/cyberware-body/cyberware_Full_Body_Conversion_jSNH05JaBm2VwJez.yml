  description: >-
    The user's brain and central nervous system are transplanted into a
    cutting-edge synthetic shell at a cost and difficulty as if this cyber took
    4 System Strain. Once converted, the subject has an effective Constitution
    of 20 for System Strain purpose, but cannot be healed by conventional first
    aid or medical drugs, requiring ten minutes of repair work with a toolkit to
    repair any amount of damage, and $250 worth of parts for each hit point to
    be restored. A full conversion borg no longer requires food, water, air, or
    sleep, but each day without the latter adds one System Strain due to the
    mental stress. The conversion requires twelve hours of maintenance every two
    weeks, and missing it will result in the user's death in 2d6 days unless the
    omitted maintenance is performed. Current full-body conversion tech is
    unstable; after 1d4 years, the subject has a cumulative 5% death chance each
    year. Borgs do not take Major Injuries and gain a +6 bonus to their Trauma
    Target that stacks with existing bonuses
