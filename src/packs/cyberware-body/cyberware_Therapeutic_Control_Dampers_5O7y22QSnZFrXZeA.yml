  description: >-
    A set of customized medical and therapeutic implants are used to control the
    side-effects of a partially-successful cyberware implant. For each
    implantation of this system, the user can choose to ignore one implant
    side-effect they currently suffer. The skill check to implant this system
    can fail, but it never induces any side effects on its own.
