  description: >-
    These implants allow the user to function normally while submerged for an
    indefinite period, drawing any necessary oxygen or drinking water from the
    surrounding salt or freshwater. Normal temperature extremes are managed
    without difficulty, and pressure can be handled down to depths of one
    kilometer. Visual augments and pressure gradient sensors allow the
    equivalent of normal sight up to 30 meters even in lightless water, and
    miniaturized support jets allow three-dimensional movement at twice the
    user's normal Move rating.
