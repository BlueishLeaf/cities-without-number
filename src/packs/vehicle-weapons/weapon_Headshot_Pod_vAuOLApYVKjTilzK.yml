    <b>Headshot pods</b> are a family of guided missiles meant for mounted
    deployment on vehicles or large drones. They always target AC 10 to hit, but
    require two full consecutive rounds of aiming at a visible target to get a
    target lock on them and prime for firing on the third round. Any bystanders
    within 5 meters of the impact take damage as if from a frag grenade. A
    headshot pod missile costs $2,000.
