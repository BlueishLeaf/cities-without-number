        You have a gift with ranged weapons. While this talent most commonly
        applies to guns, it is also applicable to thrown weapons or other ranged
        weapons that can be used with the Shoot skill. For thrown weapons, you
        can't use the benefits of the Armsmaster Focus at the same time as
        Deadeye.
      level1Benefit: >-
        Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can Ready a Stowed ranged weapon as an
        Instant action. You may use a rifle or two-handed ranged weapon even
        when an enemy is within melee range, albeit at a -4 hit penalty. You may
        add your Shoot skill level to a ranged weapon's damage roll.
      level2Benefit: >-
        You can reload guns, crossbows, or other slow-loading weapons as an On
        Turn action, provided they don't take more than a round to reload. You
        can use ranged weapons of any size in melee without penalty. Once per
        scene, as an On Turn action when target shooting at an inanimate,
        non-creature target, you automatically hit unless you roll a 2 on your
        Shoot skill check or the shot is impossible.

        <b>Advanced weapons</b> employ modern polymers, sophisticated
        metallurgy, fractal edges, electro-stun tech, and a small legion of
        marketers to sell products that are distinctly superior to the plain
        steel edges of a prior age. An advanced micro-edged butcher knife can go
        through bone like bamboo and keep an edge for weeks between sharpenings.
        The more martial offerings go to even greater lengths in their
        marketing, with some enterprising serial killers and gang enforcers
        inking exclusivity deals with particular knife manufacturers. Due to the
        sheer ubiquity and availability of melee weapons, they're often treated
        with less suspicion than firearms. A corp cop might bring somebody in
        for an "illegal knife", but only if he already wanted them for a
        different and better reason. Nightclubs and bars might expect firearms
        to go in the locker at the entrance, but they're often disinclined to go
        combing their patrons for every suspiciously-sharp hair ornament or
        multipurpose fashion accessory they might carry.
