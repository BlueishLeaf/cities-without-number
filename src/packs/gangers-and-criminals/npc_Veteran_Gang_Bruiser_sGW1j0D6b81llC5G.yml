        Assorted retractable blades and spikes are implanted in the user's

        1d8/x3 and can be rolled with either Stab or Punch as the relevant
        combat skill. The Punch skill does not add damage to Body Blades
        attacks. When not in use, the blades are perceptible only to a medical
        scan.

        <b>Light and heavy pistols</b> are categorized by the caliber of the
        bullet they fire. Some operators prefer the low recoil and high mag
        capacity possible with a low-caliber round, while others like to have a
        little more certainty in dropping the targets they hit.
