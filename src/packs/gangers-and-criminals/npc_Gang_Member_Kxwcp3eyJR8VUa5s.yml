        <b>Light and heavy pistols</b> are categorized by the caliber of the
        bullet they fire. Some operators prefer the low recoil and high mag
        capacity possible with a low-caliber round, while others like to have a
        little more certainty in dropping the targets they hit.

        While a single cybernetic eye can be implanted, it is recommended that
        both be replaced at the same time to improve neural adaptation. These
        cybereyes are clearly artificial, though most are styled in attractive
        or striking fashions. They all have perfect 20/20 vision and integral
        flash protectors, but additional functionality must be implanted
        separately. A user with a pair of cybereyes or syntheyes halves the
        System Strain cost of cybernetic eye implants.
