  description: >-
    Find people who can be helpful to your purposes and get them to cooperate
    with you. Roll it to make useful connections with others, find people you
    know, know where to get illicit goods and services, and be familiar with
    foreign cultures and languages. You can use it in place of Talk for
    persuading people you find via this skill. Note that the people you meet via
    Connect are not necessarily inclined to work with you without a good reason;
    if you want reliably cooperative allies, you need Contacts.
