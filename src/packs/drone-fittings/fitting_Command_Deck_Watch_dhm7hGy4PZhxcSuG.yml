    The drone is equipped to monitor its surroundings autonomously and alert its
    pilot when something of interest is noticed. Its onboard intelligence is
    limited, however, and it can only handle about a sentence's worth of
    specific orders or subjects to be watchful for. Putting a drone in Watch
    mode is a command that takes a Main Action.
