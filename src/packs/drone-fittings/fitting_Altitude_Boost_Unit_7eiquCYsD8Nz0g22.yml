  description: >-
    Most flying drones have an effective ceiling of 1,000 meters if there are no
    scramblers to lessen the effective control range. This unit increases a
    flying drone's maximum altitude to 5,000 meters, making most effectively
    invisible to ordinary sight. Such height does, however, make it extremely
    conspicuous to aerial scanners used by city law enforcement and
    high-security corp buildings. The speed of their response will depend on the
    drone's apparent threat.
