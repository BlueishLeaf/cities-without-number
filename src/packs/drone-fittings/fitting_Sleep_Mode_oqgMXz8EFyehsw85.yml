    Sleep mode can be enabled with a Main Action command or ended with an On
    Turn command. While in sleep mode, a drone cannot fly, move, or perform
    actions, but it will continue to communicate with the pilot and observe its
    surroundings. A day of sleep mode counts as ten minutes of ordinary
    operation for battery drain purposes.
