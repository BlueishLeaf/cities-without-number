    Usable only on ground-based drones of Enc 3 or less, this fitting allows the
    drone to climb sheer surfaces at its normal movement rate, assuming the
    surface is sturdy enough to bear its weight. Most high-security buildings
    are constructed with veneers that defeat this fitting, but ordinary
    structures seldom have such measures.
