    With a Main Action command to detonate, the drone will explode, doing 3d6
    damage to anyone within ten meters, with an Evasion save for half. Subjects
    behind solid cover further halve the damage. Drones reduced to zero hit
    points are too badly damaged to respond to detonation commands.
