  description: >-
    The drone is equipped with reactive chemical booster that can be ignited to
    give it a very brief burst of tremendous speed. When activated as a Move
    action, the burner launches the drone up to 500 meters in a straight line.
    The boost is not precise enough to use as an aimed weapon, but solid
    obstacles in front of the drone will suffer half the drone's HP in damage
    and inflict all of theirs on the drone. The burner functions only once
    before it require a scene to regenerate its charge.
