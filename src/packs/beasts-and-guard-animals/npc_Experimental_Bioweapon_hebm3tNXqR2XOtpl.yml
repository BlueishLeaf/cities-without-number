  biography: >-
    <p><em><strong>This creature can makes 2 melee attacks as a Main
    Action.</strong></em></p><p>A bleeding-edge example of cybernetic overreach,
    attack animals of this grade are found only in corporate black sites or
    experimental zones. Most are insanely aggressive and all are studded with
    cybernetic fangs, monomolecular claws, bladed tentacles, and countless other
    implements of bodily ruin. They attack three times with each Main
    action.</p>
