  biography: >-
    Fabricated out of common street cats or small dogs, a “boomkitty” has a
    crude remote control harness spliced into their brain stem and a deposit of
    plastic explosive implanted into their abdomen. While they serve well as
    inconspicuous spies and observers, a handler can detonate the animal as a
    Main action, inflicting damage as per a frag grenade on anything around it.
