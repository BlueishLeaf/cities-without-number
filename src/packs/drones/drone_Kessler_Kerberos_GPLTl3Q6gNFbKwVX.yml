    Built on a large motorized tricycle chassis, the Kessler Kerberos is one of
    the largest ground drones in general production. Most serve as urban patrol
    units for municipal governments, though their heavy armor and sturdy
    construction have endeared them to operators in need of a heavy gun
    platform.
