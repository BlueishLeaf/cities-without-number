  description: >-
    <b>Shotguns</b> of various stripes can be found under the counter of
    practically every bar and shop in a slum. Simple double-barrel models can be
    made by any home gunsmith with a pulse, but the finer tolerances and more
    elaborate machining of a burst-fire capable combat shotgun leaves them as a
    more selective product. Ranges and damages given are for shot shells; slugs
    double their normal and extreme ranges but apply a -1 penalty to hit rolls.
