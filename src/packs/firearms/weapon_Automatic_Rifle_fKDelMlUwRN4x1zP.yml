    <b>Automatic rifles</b> include a large range of barely man-portable
    firearms designed to hurl vast amounts of lead through the air, and unlike
    smaller firearms, they can use suppressive fire if properly braced.
    Ammunition for these guns comes in belts or boxes. The mag rating reflects
    how many rounds the weapon can fire before needing a refill, with each
    "round" costing $50 worth of ammunition. The compactness of their loaded
    magazines still only counts as one item, however.
