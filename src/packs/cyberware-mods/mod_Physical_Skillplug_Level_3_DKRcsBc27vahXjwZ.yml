  description: >-
    Commonly-available skillplugs can be found for any skill at level-0 or
    level-1. A basic Skillplug Jack I system can only interface with
    intellectual skills that require only modest physical expertise; Know, Fix,
    or Heal could qualify for this, but Shoot, Exert, or most forms of Perform
    would not. Such physical skills require an upgraded Skillplug Jack II unit.
