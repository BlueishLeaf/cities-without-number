  description: >-
    Cause a physical device or cyberware system to damage itself through violent
    movement or self-destructive current surges. Devices smaller than a car will
    usually be disabled until repaired. Cyberware users do not take damage, but
    must make two Physical saves to resist the effect; if they fail both, the
    targeted system is disabled until the next maintenance, and if they fail
    one, its frozen for one round. A device or cyber can be targeted by this
    Verb only once per scene.
