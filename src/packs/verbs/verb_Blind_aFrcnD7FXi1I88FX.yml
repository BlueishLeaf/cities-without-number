    Deactivate a devices sensory input or make cyberware temporarily unable to
    get any input from anything but the wearers nervous system. Cybereyes are
    blind, cameras sense nothing, and laser tripwires dont register the beam.
    Blind characters cant effectively attack at range, their movement rate is
    halved, and they suffer a -4 penalty to both AC and melee hit rolls.
