    <b>Rocket launchers</b> include a wide variety of single-shot disposable
    launchers. Their general imprecision forces a -4 hit penalty against
    human-sized targets, but they inflict frag grenade damage on any target
    within 5 meters of the rocket's landing point. Specialized anti-armor
    warheads lose this frag grenade bonus, but do double damage to vehicles or
    obstacles. Operators who intend to take down enemy vehicles favor them for
    their effectiveness in that role.
