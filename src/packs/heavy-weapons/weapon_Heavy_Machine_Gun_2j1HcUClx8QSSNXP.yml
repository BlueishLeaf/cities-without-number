    <b>Heavy machine guns</b> are old tech, but reliable. Without a fixed firing
    position or vehicle mount, however, their recoil makes them almost
    uncontrollable. Due to the mass of lead involved in firing an HMG, each
    "round" of its ammunition costs $100 and counts as a full item of
    encumbrance.
