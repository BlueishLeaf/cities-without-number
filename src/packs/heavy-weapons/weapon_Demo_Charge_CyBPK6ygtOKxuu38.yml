    <b>Demo charges</b> are shaped explosive charges usually meant to knock
    human-sized holes in anything short of fortified defensive walls. While
    ineffective as thrown weapons, when used as part of a trap or ambush they
    inflict their listed damage in a cone out to normal range, with an Evasion
    save for half damage. If applied carefully to a vehicle target, the
    following explosion will inevitably destroy it. Like frag grenades, use of
    demo charges tends to be very exciting to security forces and can provoke
    more heat than many operators like to draw.
