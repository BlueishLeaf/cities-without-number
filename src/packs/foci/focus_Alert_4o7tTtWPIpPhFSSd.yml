  description: >-
    You are keenly aware of your surroundings and virtually impossible to take
    unaware. You have an instinctive alacrity of response that helps you act
    before less wary persons can think to move.
  level1Benefit: >-
    Gain Notice as a bonus skill. You cannot be surprised, nor can others use
    the Execution Attack option on you. When your group rolls initiative, your
    vigilance allows them to roll twice and take the higher roll.
  level2Benefit: >-
    In addition to the benefits of level 1, you always act first in a combat
    round unless someone else involved is also this Alert.
