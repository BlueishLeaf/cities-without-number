    Your mind and body are superbly gifted, but this very excellence leaves you
    profoundly incompatible with most cyber. You cannot accept implants except
    for minor cosmetic ones with an unmodified System Strain cost of zero. If a
    GM is mixing rules from multiple Without Number games, this Focus should not
    be allowed unless cyberware is expected equipment for all PCs. If you're
    using the deluxe version rules for magic, PCs with magical or psychic Edges
    such as Spellcaster, Summoner, or Graced cannot take this Focus.
  level1Benefit: >-
    Gain any skill as a bonus skill. Pick an attribute; its modifier increases
    by +1, up to a maximum of +3. You can make another such attribute pick at
    levels 3, 5, 7, and 10, choosing the same attribute or a different one.
    While you can still suffer Traumatic Hits, you never suffer Major Injuries.
