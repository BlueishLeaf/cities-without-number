  description: >-
    Whether a street musician, graffiti artist, underground journalist, cam
    girl, folk singer, or Robin Hood-esque thief, you have a devoted following
    of enthusiasts who are willing to help you when you need them.
  level1Benefit: >-
    Gain Perform as a bonus skill. Once per game week, with an hour or so of
    messaging, you can mobilize about a hundred of your fans to perform some act
    of your choice, provided it's no more than mildly criminal or slightly
    dangerous. Flash mobs, getaway drivers, scouting reports, tailing people, or
    instant parties might all qualify as services. Your fans don't have any
    special skills, but they'll do anything ordinary workers or civilians could
    do. If you mobilize them for donations or merch purchases, you get $1,000
    per character level, doubled at fifth level and quadrupled at tenth. You
    can't mobilize them to buy your content more than once per month.
  level2Benefit: >-
    You can mobilize up to a hundred fans per character level, though major mobs
    are likely to draw a law enforcement response. You've cultivated fan leaders
    who can pass along your wishes deniably, concealing your involvement in the
    crowd. Your donation and merch earning amounts double. Your Charisma
    modifier increases by +1, to a maximum of +2.
