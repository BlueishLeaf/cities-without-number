  description: >-
    You have the contacts and expertise to find safehouses and bolt holes that
    no one else would think to find. You know how to persuade landlords into
    helping you for nebulous future advantages.
  level1Benefit: >-
    Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. If you spend a week in a particular
    neighborhood, you can find or arrange a secure safe house and the on-call
    assistance of a local cyberdoc or medic willing to perform emergency care
    for no more than you can afford to pay. This safe house will always go
    unnoticed unless you are at Heat 8+ or specifically compromise it; even in
    that case, it will remain undiscovered for at least 24 hours if you can get
    to it without being followed. If a safe house is burnt, you can find a new
    one with another week's work. A PC can't have more safe houses active at
    once than their character level.
  level2Benefit: >-
    Your safe houses are actively protected by the local authorities, be they
    gang members, paid-off cops, or cooperative corp security. Provided you
    don't make them angry, they'll defend you from most ordinary degrees of
    pursuit. You can find safe havens geared with the equivalent of tech
    workshops or level one cyberclinics.
