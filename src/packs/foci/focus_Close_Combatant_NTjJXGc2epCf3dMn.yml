  description: >-
    You've had all too much practice at close-in fighting and desperate
    struggles with pistol or blade. You're extremely skilled at avoiding injury
    in melee combat, and at level 2 you can dodge through a melee scrum without
    fear of being knifed in passing.
  level1Benefit: >-
    Gain any combat skill as a bonus skill. You can use pistol-sized ranged
    weapons in melee without suffering penalties for the proximity of melee
    attackers. You ignore Shock damage from melee assailants, even if you're
    unarmored at the time.
  level2Benefit: >-
    The Shock damage from your melee attacks treats all targets as if they were
    AC 10. The Fighting Withdrawal combat action is treated as an On Turn action
    for you and can be performed freely.
