  description: >-
    While anyone can drive a drone under casual circumstances, your knack for it
    is something unusual.
  level1Benefit: >-
    Gain Drive and Fix as bonus skills. You acquire or start play with a Remote
    Control Unit cybersystem and its installation. Through connections,
    scavenging, and parts repurpose, you have free drones and their weapons and
    fittings worth no more than the budget given in section 1.6.2. You can
    repair these drones without needing spare parts, and destroyed drones can be
    replaced with a week's work. You always have the equivalent of a drone
    repair kit on you at no Encumbrance cost.
  level2Benefit: >-
    You can use the Assume Command drone action once per round as an On Turn
    action. Once per scene, gain a bonus Main Action to command a drone. Any
    drones you control gain a +2 bonus to their hit rolls, whether or not you're
    personally firing their weaponry.
