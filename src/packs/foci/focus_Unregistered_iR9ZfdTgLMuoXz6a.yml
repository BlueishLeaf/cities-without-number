  description: >-
    Whether by unrecorded birth, database corruption, or sheer luck, you simply
    do not exist in any government or corporate database. If taken with the Many
    Faces Focus, your own identity is lost, but you can create others for your
    own uses. If this Focus is taken after character creation, it means your
    existing records have become hopelessly corrupted and lost.
  level1Benefit: >-
    You have no government or corporate database records associated with you,
    and it is almost impossible to add any such records without them ending up
    corrupted or deleted within a week. Human beings can remember you, but they
    can't rely on computerized records to keep track of you or your activities.
    You can keep money on credit chips or in cash, but banking or formal
    property ownership is almost impossible for you.
