  description: >-
    Healing comes naturally to you, and you're particularly gifted at preventing
    the quick bleed-out of wounded allies and comrades.
  level1Benefit: >-
    Gain Heal as a bonus skill. You may attempt to stabilize one
    mortally-wounded adjacent person per round as an On Turn action. When
    rolling Heal skill checks, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.
  level2Benefit: >-
    Pharmaceuticals or other technological healing devices applied by you heal
    twice as many hit points as normal. Using only basic medical supplies, you
    can heal 1d6+Heal skill hit points of damage to every injured or wounded
    person in your group with ten minutes of first aid spread among them. Such
    healing adds no System Strain, but can be applied to a given target only
    once per day.
