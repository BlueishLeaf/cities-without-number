  description: >-
    <p>You were wired to kill, and you can’t turn it off. The longer between
    kills, the more everything starts looking like a weapon, and everyone starts
    looking like a throat to cut. When it gets really bad, the wires won’t let
    you think of anything but your real purpose, what you made yourself to be.
    <strong>Effect: Must personally kill at least one person a week, or check
    for Alienation for each day beyond without a murder.</strong></p>
