  description: >-
    <p>Your cyber is telling you to kill. It’s constantly reminding you of
    active enemies or weak points on targets, and you have to keep rejecting
    confirmation prompts for killing blows. It’s only let- ting you think about
    trajectories and kill counts, about threats and unfinished terminations. You
    can’t think with a live enemy around. <strong>Effect: You can’t run from
    combat after you’ve suffered hit point damage in it. If you choose to flee,
    check for Alienation.</strong></p>
