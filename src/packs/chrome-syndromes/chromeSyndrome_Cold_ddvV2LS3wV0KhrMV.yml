    <p>The hormonal adjustments are fraying your ability to form emotional bonds
    with others. You intellectually may know they love you and you may have
    every reason to love them, but it’s a distant abstraction to you. It’s not a
    real feeling, like the hate, or lust, or longing that still some- times
    sparks in you. You stick with your friends out of habit or rational
    calculation. <strong>Effect: You are unable to feel love or affection for
    others. Lose your closest Contact.</strong></p>
