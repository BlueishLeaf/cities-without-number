    <p>The combat augs are great for suppressing fear. Honestly, it feels so
    good that you just leave them on all the time. Being able to live your life
    without worry or anxiety is such a tremendous relief, even if it sometimes
    makes you overlook some things. <strong>Effect: Your maximum HP is decreased
    by 20%, rounded down, because your survival instincts are dulled. If an NPC,
    your Morale is 12.</strong></p>
