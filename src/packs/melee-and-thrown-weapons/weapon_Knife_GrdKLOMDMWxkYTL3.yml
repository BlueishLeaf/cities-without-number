    <b>Knives, clubs, swords,</b> and other simple melee weapons are available
    almost anywhere on the street. Particularly impoverished gangers sometimes
    fashion makeshift machetes and improvised shivs when better can't be
    obtained. Such weapons are effectively free, but have a -1 penalty to hit
    and damage rolls due to their ungainly make.
