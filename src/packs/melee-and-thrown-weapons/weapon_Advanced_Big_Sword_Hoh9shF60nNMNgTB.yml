    <b>Advanced weapons</b> employ modern polymers, sophisticated metallurgy,
    fractal edges, electro-stun tech, and a small legion of marketers to sell
    products that are distinctly superior to the plain steel edges of a prior
    age. An advanced micro-edged butcher knife can go through bone like bamboo
    and keep an edge for weeks between sharpenings. The more martial offerings
    go to even greater lengths in their marketing, with some enterprising serial
    killers and gang enforcers inking exclusivity deals with particular knife
    manufacturers. Due to the sheer ubiquity and availability of melee weapons,
    they're often treated with less suspicion than firearms. A corp cop might
    bring somebody in for an "illegal knife", but only if he already wanted them
    for a different and better reason. Nightclubs and bars might expect firearms
    to go in the locker at the entrance, but they're often disinclined to go
    combing their patrons for every suspiciously-sharp hair ornament or
    multipurpose fashion accessory they might carry.
