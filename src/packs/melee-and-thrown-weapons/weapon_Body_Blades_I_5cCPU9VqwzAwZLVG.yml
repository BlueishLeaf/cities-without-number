    Assorted retractable blades and spikes are implanted in the user's limbs.
    Their unarmed attacks do 1d8 damage, Shock of 2/15, Trauma Die 1d8/x3 and
    can be rolled with either Stab or Punch as the relevant combat skill. The
    Punch skill does not add damage to Body Blades attacks. When not in use, the
    blades are perceptible only to a medical scan.
