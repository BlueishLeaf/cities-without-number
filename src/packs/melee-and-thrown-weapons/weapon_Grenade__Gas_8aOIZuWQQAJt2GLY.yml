  description: >-
    <b>Gas grenades</b> create a 10-meter-diameter cloud of opaque, choking,
    irritating gas that disperses in one round. They inflict non-lethal damage,
    halved on a successful Physical save, and are useless against targets with
    breathing protection. They provide full concealment for those within the
    gas. <b>Smoke grenades</b> are harmless, but provide the same 10-meter dome
    of concealment where it's necessary. Gas and smoke aren't enough to defeat
    IR or augmented visuals.
