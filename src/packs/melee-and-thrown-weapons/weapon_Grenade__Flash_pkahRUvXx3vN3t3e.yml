  description: >-
    <b>Flash grenades</b> force victims without eye and ear protection to make a
    Physical save; on a failure, the victim loses their next Main Action and
    takes a -2 penalty to hit rolls and AC for the next 1d6 rounds. Flashbang
    effects don't stack, and a target who makes their save cannot be flashbanged
    again that same round.
