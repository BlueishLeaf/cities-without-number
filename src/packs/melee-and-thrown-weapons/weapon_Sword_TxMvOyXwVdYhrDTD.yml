    <b>Knives, clubs, swords, and other simple melee weapons</b> are available
    almost anywhere on the street. Particularly impoverished gangers sometimes
    fashion makeshift machetes and improvised shivs when better can't be
    obtained. Such weapons are effectively free, but have a -1 penalty to hit
    and damage rolls due to their ungainly make.
