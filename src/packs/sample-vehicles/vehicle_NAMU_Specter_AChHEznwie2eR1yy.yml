  biography: >-
    While NAMU is better known for its aircraft offerings, the Specter is a good
    example of a top-of-the-line exfil vehicle for urban operators who arent
    willing to wrench their own ride. The standard Q-cladding mod allows it to
    masquerade as an ordinary corper SUV until its occupants need to make a
    violent and rapid withdrawal from the area. The heavy weaponry and enhanced
    speed comes at a cost, however, and the Specters frame is more fragile than
    standard for its class.
