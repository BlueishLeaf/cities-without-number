  biography: >-
    The Razorback was originally intended for sale to corp drone security
    staffers, but gangs and operators have come to love its ability to deploy
    multiple drones while hauling a team of combatants. Most buyers install
    extra cargo space or upgrade the vehicles armor, though a few owners turn
    these trucks into mobile homes.
