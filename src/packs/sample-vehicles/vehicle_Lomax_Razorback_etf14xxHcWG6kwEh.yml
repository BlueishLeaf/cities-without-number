    The Razorback was originally intended for sale to corp drone security
    staffers, but gangs and operators have come to love its ability to deploy
    multiple drones while hauling a team of combatants. Most buyers install
    extra cargo space or upgrade the vehicles armor, though a few owners turn
    these trucks into mobile homes.

        +2 to the difficulty of hacking any drone controlled by someone in or
        adjacent to this vehicle. This fitting can be installed twice on Large
