  biography: >-
    When a corp has decided to stop being polite, they send a Kessler Mjolnir.
    This corp-restricted dropcraft is built to insert up to three five to
    six-man fire teams into a drop zone while providing overwatch for the
    mission. The headshot pod can inflict catastrophic damage on anything up to
    and including a main battle tank, while the autogun hoses down any
    opposition from a safe distance overhead. While devastating to gangs or
    lightly-armed insurgents, the Mjolnir does remain vulnerable to massed
    missile fire that can penetrate its ECM and bring down its relatively
    fragile airframe.
