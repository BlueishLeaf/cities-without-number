  biography: >-
    When a corp has decided to stop being polite, they send a Kessler Mjolnir.
    This corp-restricted dropcraft is built to insert up to three five to
    six-man fire teams into a drop zone while providing overwatch for the
    mission. The headshot pod can inflict catastrophic damage on anything up to
    and including a main battle tank, while the autogun hoses down any
    opposition from a safe distance overhead. While devastating to gangs or
    lightly-armed insurgents, the Mjolnir does remain vulnerable to massed
    missile fire that can penetrate its ECM and bring down its relatively
    fragile airframe.

        <b>Headshot pods</b> are a family of guided missiles meant for mounted
        deployment on vehicles or large drones. They always target AC 10 to hit,
        but require two full consecutive rounds of aiming at a visible target to
        get a target lock on them and prime for firing on the third round. Any
        bystanders within 5 meters of the impact take damage as if from a frag
        grenade. A headshot pod missile costs $2,000.
