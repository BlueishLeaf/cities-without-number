    Available only to certified corporate or government buyers, the Cortain is a
    popular rotorcraft among SWAT teams and corporate fast-response squads. The
    standard model sacrifices specialization for general utility, being fitted
    to subdue riots, perforate hard targets, and insert or extract small numbers
    of personnel. Most fly with a pilot and two gunners, though a squad of
    jump-trained operators can crowd onboard to make an aerial exit when the
    time is right.
