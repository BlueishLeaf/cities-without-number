    Available only to certified corporate or government buyers, the Cortain is a
    popular rotorcraft among SWAT teams and corporate fast-response squads. The
    standard model sacrifices specialization for general utility, being fitted
    to subdue riots, perforate hard targets, and insert or extract small numbers
    of personnel. Most fly with a pilot and two gunners, though a squad of
    jump-trained operators can crowd onboard to make an aerial exit when the
    time is right.

        <b>Shrieker guns</b> are sonic cannons used for crowd control and
        non-lethal suppression. While highly effective against unprotected
        targets, military-grade ear protection or the integral dampers in
        cyber-ears are sufficient to render the weapon useless.
