  effect: Mimic retinal patterns
  description: >-
    Aside from allowing free alteration of eye color, this mod allows the user
    to copy another person's retinal patterns. Provided they are within two
    meters, they need only meet the user's gaze for a few moments to get a good
    imprint. The eye can store up to a dozen imprints, but it takes a Main
    Action to shift from one to another. Note that it is a relatively simple
    procedure to alter a person's retinal pattern, so an important target
    alerted to the imposture may end up changing their imprint.
