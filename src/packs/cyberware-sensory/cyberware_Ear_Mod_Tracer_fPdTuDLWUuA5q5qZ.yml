  description: >-
    As an On Turn action, the user can nominate a target within 20 meters. Until
    they get more than 100 meters away from the user or pass behind a solid
    barrier, the implant's hyper-specific hearing can track their motions
    perfectly and overhear anything they say or that is said to them. The user
    can listen to one such target at a time.
