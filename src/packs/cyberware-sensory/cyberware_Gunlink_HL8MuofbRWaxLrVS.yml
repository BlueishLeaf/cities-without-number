  description: >-
    Hardwired control points interface with the onboard targeting systems of
    most modern firearms. When using a modern firearm, the PC ignores range
    penalties and negates up to 2 points of hit penalties for cover,
    concealment, or prone targets. Once per scene, as an Instant action, they
    can reroll a missed attack roll with a gun.
