  description: >-
    While normal in appearance, touch reveals the synthetic nature of these
    ears. Some owners prefer to style them in fanciful or unnatural ways. While
    the base model provides only normal human hearing, all are equipped with ear
    protection against loud noises. A pair of cyberears or synthears halves the
    System Strain cost of ear implants.
