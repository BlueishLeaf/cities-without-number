  description: >-
    The user can navigate even in darkness or while blinded by means of
    ultrasonic sensors, being able to construct a crude map of people and
    obstacles in front of them out to 20 meters. This sense is the equivalent of
    vision, though it can't discern details more subtle than faces.
