    Spoof a device with false sensor input. A camera can be made to record
    nonexistent scenes, a minefield can be made to see phantom intrusions, a
    drone can feed the operator false visuals, and a turret can be made to
    mistake friends for foes. This Verb cant control a device directly, however,
    and must rely on feeding it false sensor data.
