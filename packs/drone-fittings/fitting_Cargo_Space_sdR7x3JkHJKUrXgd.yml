  description: >-
    Most drones are designed to carry only their own weight. This fitting
    upgrades engines and adds cargo mounts to the drone's exterior; it can carry
    up to 3 points of Encumbrance now, but the drone's own Encumbrance value is
    increased by one. Any additional cargo it carries is added to this burden,
    of course. Carried cargo is sealed within the drone and requires a Main
    Action to dig out.
