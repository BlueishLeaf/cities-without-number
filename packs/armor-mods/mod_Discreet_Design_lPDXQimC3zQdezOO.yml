    The armor is carefully tailored and adjusted to be less imposing. Obvious
    armor is made Subtle by this mod, though it suffers a -2 penalty to its
    ranged and melee AC. The armor retains its original bulk, but its lines,
    drapes, and fabrics now appear to be particularly voluminous fashion couture
    rather than protective equipment.
