The more martial offerings go to even greater lengths in their marketing, with some enterprising serial killers and gang enforcers inking exclusivity deals with particular knife manufacturers. Due to the sheer ubiquity and availability of melee weapons, they're often treated with less suspicion than firearms. A corp cop might bring somebody in for an \"illegal knife\", but only if he already wanted them for a different and better reason.
