This corp-restricted dropcraft is built to insert up to three five to six-man fire teams into a drop zone while providing overwatch for the mission. The headshot pod can inflict catastrophic damage on anything up to and including a main battle tank, while the autogun hoses down any opposition from a safe distance overhead. While devastating to gangs or lightly-armed insurgents, the Mjolnir does remain vulnerable to massed missile fire that can penetrate its ECM and bring down its relatively fragile airframe.",
