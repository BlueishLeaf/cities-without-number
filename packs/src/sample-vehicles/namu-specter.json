    "biography": "While NAMU is better known for its aircraft offerings, the Specter is a good example of a top-of-the-line exfil vehicle for urban operators who aren’t willing to wrench their own ride. The standard Q-cladding mod allows it to masquerade as an ordinary corper SUV until its occu- pants need to make a violent and rapid withdrawal from the area. The heavy weaponry and enhanced speed comes at a cost, however, and the Specter’s frame is more fragile than standard for its class.",
