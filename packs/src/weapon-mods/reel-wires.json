    "description": "A thrown weapon is linked to a wrist spool with retractable wires that allow its retriev- al as an On Turn action. The wires can be cut by a properly-timed attack with a sharp weapon, but are too thin and sharp to be easily grabbed. The wires can drag up to 20 kilos of mass when retracting. Replacing broken wires takes fifteen minutes.",
