The first activates on any human-sized approach within 1 meter, inflicting damage in a 2-me- ter radius with an Evasion save for half. Anti-vehi- cle mines can only be activated by vehicular levels of ground pressure or vehicle-sized proximate metal masses, but do their damage in a 5-meter radius. Hu- mans get an Evasion save for half damage in either case.",
