    "description": "<b>Gas grenades</b> create a 10-meter-diameter cloud of opaque, choking, irritating gas that disperses in one round. They inflict non-lethal damage, halved on a successful Physical save, and are useless against targets with breathing protection. They provide full concealment for those within the gas. <b>Smoke grenades</b> are harmless, but provide the same 10-meter dome of concealment where it's necessary. Gas and smoke aren't enough to defeat IR or augmented visuals.",
