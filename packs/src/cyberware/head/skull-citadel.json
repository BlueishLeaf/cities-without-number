Barring dismemberment or the use of high-powered ammunition directly on the target's head, the subject ignores head-affecting Major Injuries and can be stabilized even as long as ten minutes after their technical \"death\". Each such delayed revivification permanently reduces a randomly-chosen attribute by 2 points, however. This ability damage cannot be undone.",
