For roughly one hour, users gain a +2 bonus to Morale checks and experience no immediate emotional trauma from performing even the most heinous and violent actions. The drug is a favorite prefight dose among gangers, and used as self-medication among many of them who would otherwise be incapacitated by the emotional scars of what they've done.",
