        Instant action. You may use a rifle or two-handed ranged weapon even
        when an enemy is within melee range, albeit at a -4 hit penalty. You may
        add your Shoot skill level to a ranged weapon's damage roll.
      level2Benefit: >-
        You can reload guns, crossbows, or other slow-loading weapons as an On
        Turn action, provided they don't take more than a round to reload. You
        can use ranged weapons of any size in melee without penalty. Once per
        scene, as an On Turn action when target shooting at an inanimate,
        non-creature target, you automatically hit unless you roll a 2 on your
        Shoot skill check or the shot is impossible.

        <b>Advanced weapons</b> employ modern polymers, sophisticated

        through bone like bamboo and keep an edge for weeks between sharpenings.
        The more martial offerings go to even greater lengths in their
        marketing, with some enterprising serial killers and gang enforcers
        inking exclusivity deals with particular knife manufacturers. Due to the
        sheer ubiquity and availability of melee weapons, they're often treated
        with less suspicion than firearms. A corp cop might bring somebody in
        for an "illegal knife", but only if he already wanted them for a
        different and better reason. Nightclubs and bars might expect firearms
        to go in the locker at the entrance, but they're often disinclined to go
        combing their patrons for every suspiciously-sharp hair ornament or
