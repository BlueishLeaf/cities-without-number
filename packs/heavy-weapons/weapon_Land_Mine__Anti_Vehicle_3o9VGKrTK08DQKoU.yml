    <b>Land mines</b> come in anti-personnel and anti-vehicle flavors. The first
    activates on any human-sized approach within 1 meter, inflicting damage in a
    2-meter radius with an Evasion save for half. Anti-vehicle mines can only be
    activated by vehicular levels of ground pressure or vehicle-sized proximate
    metal masses, but do their damage in a 5-meter radius. Humans get an Evasion
    save for half damage in either case.
