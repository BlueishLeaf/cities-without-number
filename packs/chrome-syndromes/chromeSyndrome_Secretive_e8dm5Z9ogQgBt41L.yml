    <p>Your social protocols know best. They’re telling you not to say that,
    warning you that you’ll ruin everything if you admit it. You’re supposed to
    say something better, something more appropriate, and the prompts keep
    screaming at you if you try to defy them. <strong>Effect: You cannot
    entirely truthfully answer any question that doesn’t relate to common
    knowledge or your wishes in a business trans- action. If you do so, check
    for Alienation for each topic that’s truthfully discussed in a
    scene.</strong></p>
