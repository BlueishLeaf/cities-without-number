    <p>Your hardware isn’t meant to be restrained. It hurts to leave the
    limiters on; the confirma- tion prompts keep blaring in your brain and it
    feels like you’re suffocating when you don’t let them work according to
    spec. Sub-optimal per- formance feels like something sharp digging in your
    head. <strong>Effect: You cannot engage in non-lethal combat, though you
    don’t necessarily need to coup de grace downed foes. Check for Alienation
    each round you attack someone with non-lethal intent.</strong></p>
