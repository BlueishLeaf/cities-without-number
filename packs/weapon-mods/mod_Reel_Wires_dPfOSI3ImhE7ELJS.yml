  description: >-
    A thrown weapon is linked to a wrist spool with retractable wires that allow
    its retrieval as an On Turn action. The wires can be cut by a properly-timed
    attack with a sharp weapon, but are too thin and sharp to be easily grabbed.
    The wires can drag up to 20 kilos of mass when retracting. Replacing broken
    wires takes fifteen minutes.
